# ha-devreg

This program reads the device registry of home assistant and creates a csv file. The csv file can be opened in a spreadsheet program (libreoffice calc).
Note that it must be run from the home directory of home assistant.
Or you can change the path in the "open" functions to point to the correct directory.
